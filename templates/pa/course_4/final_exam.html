<div class="text-left">

<P>1. In designing NFIP, Congress required that premiums for certain properties be
  offered at prices below those for full-risk premiums. Why? <BR>
  <input type="radio" name="1" value="maison"> Pressure from consumer groups<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="1" value="correct"> Encourage participation in the program <BR>
  <input type="radio" name="1" value="quatre"> Lobbying by insurance companies<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="1" value="poisson"> It was a declared emergency<BR>
</p>

<P>2. NFIP underwriting and risk-management programs base many of their formulas, in part,
  on a geographic areas BFE. This abbreviation stands for: <BR>
  <input type="radio" name="2" value="maison">  Best Flood Estimate<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="2" value="quatre"> Biennial Floodwater Estuation<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="2" value="corre"> Basic Financial Evaluation<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="2" value="correct"> Base Flood Elevation<BR>
</p>

<P>3. Congress has modified the NFIP several times. The Biggert–Waters
  Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 designed:<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="3" value="maison"> Hold-harmless agreements and other modifications that limit the NFIP's
  exposure to certain consumer-advocacy lawsuits<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="3" value="quatre"> More aggressive marketing and advertising of the NFIP, so that it
  would have an "even footing" with private-sector alternatives<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="3" value=""> A series of risk management procedures that raised NFIP
  premiums, ensuring the program's long-term financial stability<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="3" value="correct"> To allow premiums to rise to
  reflect the true risk of living in high-flood areas<BR>
</p>

<P>4. According to the NFIP's numbers, repetitive loss properties represent only about one
  percent of its total number of policies in force, but account for: <BR>
  <input type="radio" name="4" value="maison"> 20 to 25 percent of claims<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="4" value="quatre"> about 15 percent of claims<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="4" value="correct"> 25 to 30 percent of claims<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="4" value="poisson"> 35 to 40 percent of claims<BR>
</p>

<P>5. If a structure has a Base Flood Elevation (BFE) of 6ft.  What does that mean? <BR>
  <input type="radio" name="5" value="correct"> The lowest floor would have to
  meet the requirements of 6 feet above mean sea level<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="5" value="maison">  It can handle 6 feet of flooding before sustaining damages<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="5" value="quatre">  The first 6 feet of damage will be a deductible<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="5" value="xxx"> The flooding will not rise above 6 ft<BR>

</p>

<P>6.  The NFIP offers two types of flood insurance premiums:<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="6" value="maison"> Standard and preferred<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="6" value="quatre"> Standard and substandard<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="6" value="hhhhhh"> Standard and subsidized<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="6" value="correct"> Subsidized and full-risk<BR>
</p>

<P>7.  NFIP Flood Maps include two main elements. These are:<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="7" value="maison"> Socio-economic Characteristics Map (SECM) , Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="7" value="correct"> Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) , Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="7" value="quatre"> Predictive Incidence Rate Map (PIRM) , Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="7" value="poisson"> Geological Incidence Rate Map (GIRM) and Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)<BR>
</p>

<P>8.  Flood insurance may not be available for buildings and/or contents located in coastal barriers or otherwise
  protected areas. These areas are listed in a separate:<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="8" value="maison"> High-Risk Flood Loss Properties System<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="8" value="quatre"> Assigned-Risk Property Insurance System<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="8" value=""> Flood-prone Loss Elimination System<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="8" value="correct"> Coastal Barrier Resources System <BR>
</p>

<P>9. Why is flood insurance is better than disaster assistance?<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="9" value="maison"> Their is a 60 day waiting period for disaster assistance<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="9" value="correct"> Disaster assistance loans from SBA are
  usually more costly than flood insurance premiums<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="9" value="soleil"> Flood insurance pays out more money<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="9" value="poisson"> You can't be denied<BR>
</p>

<P>10. The NFIP's full-risk rates (which apply to non-subsidized premiums) are:<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="10" value="correct"> Often based on outdated information and processes, so even these rates may not reflect the actual risk of flood-related loss<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="10" value="ccc"> Subsidized in part under the Federal Flood Insurance Equalization Program (FFIEP)<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="10" value="coct"> Weighted, actuarially, to counterbalance the cost of the subsidized premiums-however, this weighting doesn't apply to Write-Your-Own policies<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="10" value="wrong"> Subject to administrative review and adjustment before policies can be put into force-which usually creates a backlog of pending coverage<BR>

</p>

<P>11.  From an actuarial standpoint, there are several major differences between the NFIP and conventional property insurance programs.
  Which of the following is NOT one of those differences?<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="11" value="correct">  The NFIP is required to submit all "significant" management decisions to FEMA for approval<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="11" value="coct"> The NFIP is not structured to build a capital surplus<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="11" value="wrong"> The NFIP is unable to reject high-risk applicants<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="11" value="wrong"> The NFIP is subject to statutory limits on rate increases<BR>
</p>

<P>12.  According to one watchdog agency NFIP's rate-setting process for some of its premiums may not ensure that those premium
  rates reflect the actual risk of flooding and therefore:<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="12" value="correct">  May increase NFIP's financial risk<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="12" value="coct"> May decrease NFIP's financial risk<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="12" value="wrong"> May benefit certain NFIP policyholders, particularly lower-income policyholders<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="12" value="wrong"> May penalize certain NFIP policyholders, particularly lower-income policyholders<BR>
</p>

<P>13. NFIP risk-modeling efforts include Army Corps of Engineers flood-damage calculation metrics known by the acronyms PELV and DELV.
  What do these abbreviations stand for?<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="13" value="coct"> "Predictive elevation value" and "Deductive elevation value"<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="13" value="wrong"> "Passive enforcement load vector" and "Definitive enforcement load vector"<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="13" value="correct">  "Probability of elevation" and "Damage by elevation” <BR>
  <input type="radio" name="13" value="wrong"> "Precise elevation value" and "Designated elevation value"<BR>
</p>

<P>14. Because of the NFIP's actuarial problems, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has placed
  the program on its high-risk list. What does that mean?<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="14" value="coct"> The NFIP cannot borrow short-term operational funds in the same manner that other government administered insurance programs can<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="14" value="wrong"> The NFIP's annual budget must undergo additional review by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB)<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="14" value="correct"> The NFIP is likely to cost taxpayers significantly more than its current financial reports indicate <BR>
  <input type="radio" name="14" value="wrong"> The NFIP is subject to random financial audits from investigators with the Treasury Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) or the FBI<BR>
</p>

<P>15. Except for a couple of exceptions, flood insurance takes effect ___ from the date of application submission and premium payment.<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="15" value="coct"> 60 days <BR>
  <input type="radio" name="15" value="correct">  30 days <BR>
  <input type="radio" name="15" value="wrong"> 90 days <BR>

<P>17. NFIP has traditionally identified flood hazard areas on maps that are provided to communities for carrying out their responsibilities.
  These maps assign flood zone designations based on what?<BR>
