</p>
<P>15. The NFIP's full-risk rates (which apply to non-subsidized premiums) are:<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="15" value="coct"> Subsidized in part under the Federal Flood Insurance Equalization Program (FFIEP)<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="15" value="correct">  Often based on outdated information and processes, so even these rates may not reflect the actual risk of flood-related loss<BR>
  <input type="radio" name="15" value="wrong"> Weighted, actuarially, to counterbalance the cost of the subsidized premiums-however, this weighting doesn't apply to Write-Your-Own policies<BR>
