one of the best ways to track down your app's errors and unexpected behavior in future is by provisioning
a monitoring Add-On such as New Relic, Librato or Scout APM. These Add-Ons will track a web request through
your entire stack and surface useful information for debugging.

 Without a monitoring Add-On installed, it's
very difficult for us to help troubleshoot issues you may be having with the Heroku platform.
We also highly recommend provisioning a logging Add-On such as Papertrail, Timber.io or others shown on our
Add-Ons page. These Add-Ons will store more logs than Heroku does (which is currently only 1,500 lines) and also
allow you to search your logs for keywords or by date range to help make debugging more efficient


-Are you using sessions to track the information? Is it possible the session is expiring for some users?
Yes and yes. In the @app.route(final results) I am calling the username from sessions (name = session['name']) to get the user data
from database.  So I did a test and let the exam sit for 45 minutes before moving forward and the app broke

.-Hobby Postgres databases have a limit of 20 simultaneous connections.

Whenever you make a new deployment a new release will be created and your application would restart.
This would cause your session to expire. Dynos also restart at least once every 24 hours to maintain the health of your application,
you can refer to Automatic dyno restarts for more information about this.

Each dyno gets its own ephemeral filesystem, with a fresh copy of the most recently deployed code. During the dyno’s lifetime
its running processes can use the filesystem as a temporary scratchpad, but no files that are written are visible to processes
in any other dyno and any files written will be discarded the moment the dyno is stopped or restarted. For example, this occurs
any time a dyno is replaced due to application deployment and approximately once a day as part of normal dyno management.

Dyno Restarts using Flask
-I have an app which is a education course.  So if a user signs in at the beginning.  There user_name data will go into its own class for storage.
Then,  at the end of the course the database is accessed by the user_name and updated.  So I noticed if I do a 'git push heroku master' the app
will destroy the user_name data in the class and break the app.  I have even tried putting the data in a session['user_name'].  And it still gets deleted.
How can I run an app If it is going to randomely reboot every 24 hours and kick everyone off who is using it by deleting their user names?


There isn't a workaround to not restarting your application, however, what you can do is store the session data somewhere else like in redis.
This way even when your dynos restart your session data is not lost, this solution should also make it easier to scale up your application
in the future if required.

Storing session data on the dyno is not recommended due to their ephemeral filesystem.
UPDATE db SET course_4 = :course_4 WHERE user_name = :user_name
How do I store session data in postgres database? (flask)
Perhaps you can help me programmatically.  Lets say a user signs up for my course and inserts data into postgres database.
So i store 'user_name,  password, email, score'.   To access their User account they will sign in and we do a check like this to
pull the current User data. -- User = "SELECT * FROM database WHERE user_name = :user_name AND password = :password"  --
I understand now that the current User data can be destroyed at any time due to the dyno ephemeral filesystem.  So a User who is signed in would need to sign
in again to update their data. Since the User's user_name and password will be destroyed their is no way to access the user.
I am thinking The only way to get around this is upon user sign-in to store 2 new variables. current_user="user_name" and current_password="password".
Then if the current user data is destroyed, I can do this--- username = "SELECT * FROM database WHERE current_user = :current_user AND current_password = :current_password" ---
Than query the database with those 2 variables to get the user_name and password, then retreive the User data?
Should I use Postgres because then the current_user would need a different name for every user because 2 identical passwords would cause
conflicts.  Maybe SQLite?  I have never used that one.

I am using Postgres also, but I must be using it wrong.  Here is where I go wrong, when the user signs in with user_name and password
a local variable called User is created  -- User = "SELECT * FROM database WHERE user_name = :user_name AND password = :password"  --
Than I want to access that User later on to UPDATE the database.  But I cant't do that because the User variable can be destroyed.
get deleted) you could use Flask login and authentication to get the desired results. I found this which may be of use to you:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61916222/how-do-i-access-the-user-data-in-postgres-database-with-user-name-if-heroku-has

How do I access the User in Postgres database with user_name if Heroku has deleted the user_name value?

Flask App

I have the user sign-in with user_name + password which accesses their User data in Postgres db, I store the user_name locally to use later
to access the Postgres db to update the User data.

Using Heroku I cannot do this.  I need to store the user_name in Postgres in case the dyno runs out the user_name value will be deleted and when I want to access
the db their is no user_name to access it.  So how do I store the user_name than access it after it has been deleted?  Because I need the user_name to match the
user_name in the Postgres db to access the User account.

I feel the shit is necessary.  I think for a long time cops have been killing innocent black people and getting off scott free.
It's just now everyone has a camera so its not so easy.  Also Institutional racism is alive and well.  You see cops, DA's
medical examiners all Downplay the George Floyd execution as something other than what is was.  These are not just edge cases either
this shit been happening for 400 years
